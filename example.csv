history. Axions are one key possibility to solve the strong CP problem and
axion-like particles could be one solution to the dark matter puzzle. Given the
nature of the coupling, and the universality of free fall, nontrivial important
effects are expected in regions where gravity is strong. Here, we show that
,i. A background EM field induces an axionic instability in flat space, for
large enough electric fields. Conversely, a homogeneous harmonic axion field
induces an instability in the Maxwell sector. When carried over to curved
spacetime, this phenomena translates into generic instabilities of charged
black holes (BHs).
,ii. In the presence of charge, BH uniqueness results are lost. We find
solutions which are small deformations of the Kerr-Newman geometry and hairy
stationary solutions without angular momentum, which are `dragged' by the
axion. Axion fields must exist around spinning BHs if these are immersed in
external magnetic fields. The axion profile can be obtained perturbatively from
the electro-vacuum solution derived by Wald.
,iii. Ultralight axions trigger superradiant instabilities of spinning BHs and
form an axionic cloud in the exterior geometry. The superradiant growth can be
interrupted or suppressed through axionic or scalar couplings to EM. These
couplings lead to periodic bursts of light, which occur throughout the history
of energy extraction from the BH. We provide numerical and simple analytical
estimates for the rates of these processes.
,iv. Finally, we discuss how plasma effects can affect the evolution of
superradiant instabilities.

Our numerical computations show that for positive values of Gauss-Bonnet

gravity on large scale while restoring GR predictions on scales in which the
theory is experimentally confirmed, typically for the local tests within the
solar system. In this regard, stealth black hole solutions provide an
interesting path to discuss the viability of any extension of GR on local
scales. For scalar-tensor extensions, such black hole configurations correspond
to vacuum solutions of GR and admit a scalar dressing which does not gravitate,
revealing itself only at the perturbative level. It was recently shown that the
subclass of Horndeski, consistent with the recent observational constraint
$c_{\text{grav}}=c_{\text{light}}$, does not admit such configuration when the
scalar field is time-dependent. In this letter, we scan the viable degenerate
higher order scalar tensor (DHOST) theories satisfying the constraint
$c_{\text{grav}}=c_{\text{light}}$ and derive the conditions on the Lagrangian
of this theory to admit a stealth Schwarzschild-(A)dS solution dressed with a
linear time-dependent scalar field, and assuming a constant kinetic term. As a
by-product, we show that the subclass of the Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi
(GLPV) theory satisfying $c_{\text{grav}}=c_{\text{light}}$ admits a pure
Schwarzschild solution but not its (A)dS extension, at least for our specific
scalar profil, generalizing previous result on stealth black hole solutions in
the Horndeski subclass.

which measure the curvature and torsion of the geometry. We show that the new
degrees of freedom associated to the particle-like elements can be understood
as edge modes, which appear in the decomposition of the continuum theory into
subsystems and do not cancel out in the gluing of cells along codimension 2
defects. These new particle-like edge modes are gravitationally dressed in an
explicit way. This provides a detailed explanation of the relations and
differences between the loop gravity phase space and the one deduced from the

small scales. Since relativity is important at large scales and non-linear loop
corrections are important at small scales, the proper calculation of the
observed bispectrum in this limit requires a non-linear relativistic
calculation. We compute the matter bispectrum in general relativity in the weak
field approximation. The calculation is as involved as existing second-order
results. We find several differences with the Newtonian calculation such as the
non-cancellation of IR divergences, the need to renormalize the background, and
the fact that initial conditions must be set at second order in perturbation
theory. For the bispectrum, we find relativistic corrections to be as large as
the newtonian result in the squeezed limit. In that limit relativistic one-loop
contributions, which we compute for the first time, can be as large as tree
level results and have the same $1/k^2$ dependence as a primordial local
non-Gaussianity signal where $k$ is the momentum approaching zero. Moreover, we
find the time dependence of the relavistic corrections to the bispectrum to be
the same as that of a primordial non-Gaussianity signal.

space formalism. We define a covariant phase space and compute the algebra of
symmetries at the null boundary by considering the boundary-preserving
diffeomorphisms that preserve this phase space. This algebra is the semi-direct
sum of diffeomorphisms on the two sphere and a nonabelian algebra of
supertranslations that has some similarities to supertranslations at null
infinity. By using the general prescription developed by Wald and Zoupas, we
derive the localized charges of this algebra at cross sections of the null
surface as well as the associated fluxes. Our analysis is covariant and applies
to general non-stationary null surfaces. We also derive the global charges that
generate the symmetries for event horizons, and show that these obey the same
algebra as the linearized diffeomorphisms, without any central extension. Our
results show that supertranslations play an important role not just at null
infinity but at all null boundaries, including non-stationary event horizons.
They should facilitate further investigations of whether horizon symmetries and
conservation laws in black hole spacetimes play a role in the information loss
problem, as suggested by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger.

Shapiro",(Submitted on 20 Jul 2018 (,"  Collapsing supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses $M \gtrsim 10^{4-6}M_\odot$
have long been speculated to be the seeds that can grow and become supermassive
black holes (SMBHs). We previously performed GRMHD simulations of marginally
stable magnetized $Γ= 4/3$ polytropes uniformly rotating at the
mass-shedding limit to model the direct collapse of SMSs. These configurations
are supported entirely by thermal radiation pressure and model SMSs with $M
\gtrsim 10^{6}M_\odot$. We found that around $90\%$ of the initial stellar mass
forms a spinning black hole (BH) surrounded by a massive, hot, magnetized
torus, which eventually launches an incipient jet. Here we perform GRMHD
simulations of $Γ\gtrsim 4/3$, polytropes to account for the perturbative
role of gas pressure in SMSs with $M \lesssim 10^{6}M_\odot$. We also consider
different initial stellar rotation profiles. The stars are initially seeded
with a dynamically weak dipole magnetic field that is either confined to the
stellar interior or extended from its interior into the stellar exterior. We
find that the mass of the BH remnant is $90\%-99\%$ of the initial stellar
mass, depending sharply on $Γ-4/3$ as well as on the initial stellar
rotation profile. After $t\sim 250-550M\approx 1-2\times 10^3(M/10^6M_\odot)$s
following the BH formation, a jet is launched and it lasts for $\sim
10^4-10^5(M/10^6M_\odot)$s, consistent with the duration of long gamma-ray
bursts. Our results suggest that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism powers the jet.
They are also in agreement with our proposed universal model that estimates
accretion rates and luminosities that characterize magnetized BH-disk remnant
systems that launch a jet. This model helps explain why the outgoing
luminosities for vastly different BH-disk formation scenarios all reside within
a narrow range ($\sim 10^{52 \pm 1} \rm erg/s$), roughly independent of $M$.

black holes. We specifically examine the behavior of the multipartite
entanglement represented by this model, and find that the entanglement
structure depends on the black hole mass $M$ and the frequency of the Hawking
radiation $ω$. For sufficiently small values of $Mω$, the black hole
and the radiation system becomes a separable state after the Page time and a
firewall-like structure appears. On the contrary, for larger values of
$Mω$, the entanglement between the black hole and the radiation is not
lost. These behaviors imply that owing to the monogamy property of the
multipartite entanglement, low frequency modes of the Hawking radiation
destroys the quantum correlation between the black hole and the emitted Hawking
radiation.

photosphere, generate Breit-Wigner-type spectral lines in the absorption cross
section. Absorption is enhanced whenever the wave frequency resonates with a
trapped mode, leading to a spectral profile which differs qualitatively from
that of a black hole. We introduce a model based on Nariai spacetime, in which
properties of the spectral lines are calculated in closed form. We present
numerically calculated absorption cross sections and transmission factors for
example scenarios, and show how the Nariai model captures the essential
features. We argue that, in principle, ECOs can be distinguished from black

We investigate the pair production of scalar particles in the inflaton-driven

production. The presence of the dilatonic coupling ensures the validity of the
WKB approximation at the past and the future infinities, without tuning
constant parameters. Thus, the semiclassical description is applicable in
evaluating the induced current. Solving the field equations with the induced
current, we evaluate the first-order backreaction to the electric field. It
turns out that the electric field decreases with the cosmic expansion. The
result indicates that the no-anisotropic hair theorem for inflation holds true
regardless of whether the dilatonic coupling is present or not.

Axions or axion-like particles are a key possibility, and arise in mechanisms
to solve the strong CP problem but also in low-energy limits of string theory.
Extensive experimental and observational efforts are actively looking for
`axionic' imprints. Independently on their nature, their abundance, and on
their contribution to the dark matter problem, axions form dense clouds around
spinning black holes, grown by superradiant mechanisms. It was recently
suggested that once couplings to photons are considered, an exponential

Here we solve numerically the classical problem in different setups. We show
that laser-like emission from clouds exists at the classical level, and we
provide the first quantitative description of the problem.

theories of gravity have received increased attention lately, motivated from
both theoretical and observational aspects. Gravitational wave observations
opened new possibilities for testing the viability of such theories in the
strong-field regime. One could test each theory against observed data one at a
time, though a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a
theory-agnostic way and map such information to that on specific theories
afterward. One example of such model-independent tests with gravitational waves
is the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism, where one introduces generic
parameters in the amplitude and phase that capture non-Einsteinian effects. In
this paper, we derive gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries
in various modified theories of gravity that violate at least one fundamental
pillar in general relativity. We achieve this by deriving relations between
corrections to the waveform amplitude/phase and those to the frequency
evolution and Kepler's third law, since the latter two have already been (or
can easily be) derived in many theories. Such an analysis allows us to derive
corrections to the waveform amplitude, which extends many of previous works
that focused on phase corrections only. Moreover, we derive gravitational
waveforms in theories with varying gravitational constant. We extend the
previous work by introducing two gravitational constants (the conservative one
entering in the binding energy and the dissipative one entering in the
gravitational wave luminosity) and allowing masses of binary constituents to
vary with time. We also correct some errors in previous literature. Our results
can be used to improve current analyses of testing general relativity as well
as to achieve new projected constraints on many modified theories of gravity.

true for a closed physical system consisting of pure antimatter in the

quantum field theories while the other one is refers Noether's theorem of
theoretical physics. However in our understanding the ultimate validity or
invalidity of this idea can be decided only by future physical experiments.
,As a consequence of the proposal we argue that the dynamical evolution of
pure macroscopic antimatter systems can be very different from that of ordinary
matter systems in the sense that sufficiently massive antimatter systems could
have stronger tendency to form black holes during time evolution than their
ordinary counterparts. Taking into account the various ""no-hair"" theorems in
black hole physics as well, as a result, antimatter could tracelessly disappear
behind black hole event horizons faster in time than ordinary matter. The
observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter could then be explained even if
their presence in the Universe was symmetric in the beginning.

detailed Hamiltonian analysis, we find that the condition requiring the kinetic
terms to be degenerate is not sufficient to evade the ghost mode in general.
This is because the primary constraint due to the degeneracy condition does not
necessarily induce a secondary constraint, if the mixings between temporal and
spatial derivatives are present. In this case, the second condition that we dub
as the consistency condition must be imposed in order to ensure the existence
of the secondary constraint and thus to remove the ghost mode. We also show how
our formalism works through an explicit example, in which the degeneracy
condition is not sufficient and thus the consistency condition must be imposed.
By employing the Stueckelberg trick, our formalism provides us a much broader

Kundt metric ansatz, the fourth-order field equations simplify to a compact

directly set the Bach parameter and/or cosmological constant equal to zero. To
interpret these spacetimes, we analyse the metric functions. In particular, we

different representations of a theory, regarded as the consequence of

issue is discussed by invoking the assumed invariance of the laws of physics --
in particular the laws of gravity -- under conformal transformations of the
metric. It is shown that Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor theories are not
well-suited to address physical equivalence of the conformal frames since the
corresponding laws of gravity are not invariant under the conformal
transformations or Weyl rescalings. The search for conformal symmetry leads us
to explore the physical consequences of Weyl-invariant theories of gravity,
that represent a natural arena where to discuss on physical equivalence of the
conformally related representations. We show that conformal invariance of the
action of a (supposedly conformal invariant) theory and of the derived motion
equations is not enough to ensure actual Weyl invariance. It is required, also,
that the underlying geometrical structure of the background spacetime be, at

their horizon areas. We extend earlier work on hot attractor black holes to
higher dimensions and add a scalar potential. In addition to the event and
Cauchy horizons, when we complexify the radial coordinate, non-extremal black
holes will generically have other horizons as well. We prove that the product
of all of the horizon areas is independent of variations of the asymptotic
moduli further generalizing the attractor mechanism for extremal black holes.
In the presence of a scalar potential, as typically appears in gauged
supergravity, we find that the product of horizon areas is not necessarily the
geometric mean of the extremal area, however. We outline the derivation of
horizon invariants for stationary backgrounds.

along the vertical direction in the Kerr metric, the radial Mach number does
not become unity at the critical point. The sonic points are, thus, formed at a
radial distance different from that where the critical points are formed. We
propose that a modified dynamical sound speed can be defined through the linear
perturbation of the full space-time dependent equations describing the
aforementioned accretion flow structure. The linear stability analysis of such
fluid equations leads to the formation of an wave equation which describes the
propagation of linear acoustic perturbation. The speed of propagation of such
perturbation can be used as the effective sound speed which makes the value of
the Mach number to be unity when evaluated at the critical points. This allows
the critical points to coalesce with the sonic points. We study how the spin
angular momentum of the black hole (the Kerr parameter) influences the value of
the effective sound speed.

non-Abelian translations and special conformal transformations reduce to two
vierbein fields in $D=4$. Besides these two vierbeine, our reduction schemes
leave only the Lorentz spin connection as an additional dynamical field in the
4-dimensional theories. We identify the corresponding actions as particular
generalizations of Einstein-Cartan theory, conformal gravity and ghost-free
bimetric gravity in first-order form.

class of examples, an open string embedded in an AdS-background yields an
effective Schwarzian action and, in the semi-classical description, the
fluctuation modes of the open string couple to this Schwarzian sector. This
leads to a maximal chaos, observed in the open string degrees of freedom,
irrespective of the gravitational background. This corresponds to the dynamics
of quark-like degrees of freedom in a strongly coupled large N_c gauge theory.
We also demonstrate a maximal chaos, resulting from an inherent D-brane
horizon, by computing the four-point out-of-time-ordered correlator of spin-one
operators. We also offer some observations and comments regarding a class of
effective theories that is described by a generic functional of a Schwarzian

the answer to the cosmic brane prescription for computing $\widetilde{S}_n

algebra codes have a similar, more general prescription. Notably, for the
AdS/CFT code to match the specific cosmic brane prescription, the code must
have maximal entanglement within eigenspaces of the area operator. This gives
us an improved definition of the area operator, and establishes a stronger
connection between the Ryu-Takayanagi area term and the edge modes in lattice
gauge theory. We also propose a new interpretation of existing holographic
tensor networks as area eigenstates instead of smooth geometries. This
interpretation would explain why tensor networks have historically had trouble
modeling the Renyi entropy spectrum of holographic CFTs, and it suggests a
method to construct holographic networks with the correct spectrum.

from the renormalizable Ho$\check{\textrm{r}}$ava action at low redshift scales
by using different cosmological and statistical tests. Assuming pure attractive
gravity, i.e., $λ>1/3$ in the Ho$\check{\textrm{r}}$ava action, we
compare the Union 2.1 supernova type Ia data with the kinematics following from
a model-independent approach. The two approaches, although compatible, lead to
explicit cosmographic constraints on the free parameters of the
Ho$\check{\textrm{r}}$ava action, which turn out to be in strong disagreement
with the $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder scenarios. To show
this, we use standard diagnostic tools of regression models, namely the Akaike
and the Bayesian Information Criteria. Using such model-independent statistical
methods, we show that Ho$\check{\textrm{r}}$ava-Lifshitz cosmology differs from
the standard dark energy scenarios, \emph{independently} of the number of free
parameters involved in the model. Since this result is valid at small redshift
domains, it indicates the presence of inconsistencies in the minimal version of
Ho$\check{\textrm{r}}$ava-Lifshitz cosmology even at the level of background
cosmology.

asymptotically AdS black holes, extending our previous results by including

thermodynamics is to ensure that the system is not over-constrained by
including the possibility of varying the `string' tensions that are responsible
for the acceleration of the black hole, yielding a first law of full
cohomogeneity. The first law assumes the standard form, with the entropy given
by one quarter of the horizon area and other quantities identified by standard
methods. In particular we compute the mass in two independent ways: through a
Euclidean action calculation and by the method of conformal completion. The
ambiguity in the choice of the normalization of the timelike Killing vector can
be fixed by explicit coordinate transformation (in the case of rotation) to the
standard AdS form or by holographic methods (in the case of charge). This
resolves a long-standing problem of formulating the thermodynamics of
accelerating black holes, opening the way to detailed studies of their phase
behaviour.

a suitable data-analysis method to detect it. We find that our method can
improve the existing constraints given by fifth-force experiments on one of the

$\sim 350$ for $m_φ= 2 \times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{eV},~10^{-14}~\mathrm{eV}$

observational evidence for their existence is a notoriously difficult task.
Current strategies to quantify the evidence for BHs all boil down to looking
for signs of highly compact, horizonless bodies. Here, we study particle
creation by objects which collapse to form ultra-compact configurations, with
surface at an areal radius $R=R_{f}$ satisfying $1-(2M/R_{f})= ε^{2}\ll
1$ with $M$ the object mass. We assume that gravitational collapse proceeds in
a `standard' manner until $R=R_{f}+2M ε^{2β}$, where $β>0$, and
then slows down to form a static object of radius $R_{f}$. In the standard
collapsing phase, Hawking-like thermal radiation is emitted, which is as strong
as the Hawking radiation of a BH with the same mass but lasts only for $\sim
40~(M/M_{\odot})[44+\ln (10^{-19}/ε)]~μ\mbox{s}$. Thereafter, in a
very large class of models, there exist two bursts of radiation separated by a
very long dormant stage. The first burst occurs at the end of the transient
Hawking radiation, and is followed by a quiescent stage which lasts for $\sim
6\times 10^{6}~(ε/10^{-19})^{-1}(M/M_{\odot})~\mbox{yr}$. Afterwards,
the second burst is triggered, after which there is no more particle production
and the star is forever dark. In a model with $β=1$, both the first and
second bursts outpower the transient Hawking radiation by a factor $\sim
10^{38}(ε/10^{-19})^{-2}$.

explicit example for an outgoing Vaidya spacetime which demonstrates that the
resulting Komar currents can yield conserved quantities that behave in a manner
expected for the energy contained in the outgoing radiation. Finally, I
describe a method for constructing another class of (non-Komar) globally
conserved currents using a scalar test field that satisfies an inhomogeneous
wave equation, and discuss two examples; the first example may provide a useful
framework for examining the arrow of time and its relationship to energy
conditions, and the second yields (with appropriate initial conditions) a
globally conserved energy- and momentum- like quantity that measures the degree
to which a given spacetime deviates from symmetry.

to a big rip singularity. We apply a quantum geometrodynamical approach by
performing an appropriate Hamiltonian study including an analysis of the

see whether the solutions to the WDW equation satisfy the DeWitt boundary

a generalised Kinnersley null tetrad in the Newman-Penrose formalism.
Subsequently in this frame and in the KNdS black hole spacetime, we prove the
separation of the Dirac equation into ordinary differential equations for the
radial and angular parts. Under specific transformations of the independent and
dependent variables we prove that the transformed radial equation for a massive
charged spin $\frac{1}{2}$ fermion in the background KNdS black hole
constitutes a highly non-trivial generalisation of Heun's equation since it
possess five regular finite singular points. Using a Regge-Wheeler-like
independent variable we transform the radial equation in the KNdS background
into a Schrödinger like differential equation and investigate its
asymptotic behaviour near the event and cosmological horizons. For the case of
a massive fermion in the background of a Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole we first
prove that the radial and angular equations that result from the separation of
Dirac's equation reduce to the generalised Heun differential equation (GHE).
The local solutions of such GHE are derived and can be described by holomorphic
functions whose power series coefficients are determined by a four-term
recurrence relation. In addition using asymptotic analysis we derive the
solutions for the massive fermion far away from the KN black hole and the
solutions near the event horizon . The determination of the separation constant

that the difference in the proper motions and/or radial velocities of the
components of nearby wide binaries appear larger than predicted by Kepler's
law's, indicating a potential breakdown of GR at low accelerations. These
studies have not accounted for projection effects owing to the different
position of the two stars on the celestial sphere. I show that two stars in a
wide binary with identical 3D space velocities often have significantly
different proper motions and radial velocities purely due to projection
effects. I construct a sample of simulated binaries that follow Kepler's laws
and have similar phase-space distributions to the observed samples of nearby
binaries. Beyond separations of $\sim$0.1 pc, direct comparison of the
components' proper motions would suggest strong tensions with GR, even though
the simulated binaries follow Kepler's laws by construction. The magnitude of
the apparent disagreement is similar to that found observationally, suggesting
that the apparent tension between observations and GR may largely be due to
projection effects. I discuss prospects for constraining gravity at low
accelerations with wide binaries. Robust tests of GR are possible with current
data but require measurements of 3D velocities. Further work is also needed to
model contamination from unbound moving groups and unrecognized hierarchical
