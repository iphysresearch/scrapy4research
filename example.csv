High-accuracy mass, spin, and recoil predictions of generic black-hole  merger remnants","Vijay Varma,Davide Gerosa,François Hébert,Leo C. Stein,Hao Zhang",(Submitted on 24 Sep 2018)," We present accurate fits for the remnant properties of generically precessing
binary black holes, trained on large banks of numerical-relativity simulations.
We use Gaussian process regression to interpolate the remnant mass, spin, and
recoil velocity in the 7-dimensional parameter space of precessing black-hole
binaries. For precessing systems, our errors in estimating the remnant mass,
spin magnitude, and kick magnitude are lower than those of existing fitting
formulae by at least an order of magnitude. In addition, we also model the
remnant spin and kick directions. Improvement is also reported for aligned-spin
systems. Being trained directly on precessing simulations, our fits are free
from ambiguities regarding the initial frequency at which precessing quantities
are defined. As a byproduct, we also provide error estimates for all fitted
quantities, which can be consistently incorporated into current and future
gravitational-wave parameter-estimation analyses. Our model(s) are made
publicly available through a fast and easy-to-use Python module called
surfinBH.

Moradi,J. F. Rodriguez",(Submitted on 27 Feb 2018 (," The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration has announced the detection of GW170817 and has
associated it with GRB 170817A. These signals have been followed after 11 hours
by the optical and infrared emission of AT 2017gfo. The origin of this complex
phenomenon has been attributed to a neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) merger.
In order to probe this association we confront our current understanding of the
gravitational waves and associated electromagnetic radiation with four observed
GRBs originating in binaries composed of different combinations NSs and white
dwarfs (WDs). We consider 1) GRB 090510 the prototype of NS-NS merger leading
to a black hole (BH); 2) GRB 130603B the prototype of a NS-NS merger leading to
massive NS (MNS) with an associated kilonova; 3) GRB 060614 the prototype of a
NS-WD merger leading to a MNS with an associated kilonova candidate; 4) GRB
170817A the prototype of a WD-WD merger leading to massive WD with an
associated AT 2017gfo-like emission. None of these systems support the above
mentioned association. The clear association between GRB 170817A and AT 2017gfo
has led to introduce a new model based on on a new subfamily of GRBs
originating from WD-WD mergers. We show how this novel model is in agreement
with the exceptional observations in the optical, infrared, X- and gamma-rays
of GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo.

Effective Field Theory of Black Hole Echoes","C.P. Burgess,Ryan Plestid,Markus Rummel",(Submitted on 2 Aug 2018 (," Gravitational wave `echoes' during black-hole merging events have been
advocated as possible signals of modifications to gravity in the strong-field
(but semiclassical) regime. In these proposals the observable effect comes
entirely from the appearance of nonzero reflection probability at the horizon,
which vanishes for a standard black hole. We show how to apply EFT reasoning to
these arguments, using and extending earlier work for localized systems that
relates choices of boundary condition to the action for the physics responsible
for these boundary conditions. EFT reasoning applied to this action argues that
linear `Robin' boundary conditions dominate at low energies, and we determine
the relationship between the corresponding effective coupling (whose value is
the one relevant low-energy prediction of particular modifications to General
Relativity for these systems) and the phenomenologically measurable
near-horizon reflection coefficient. Because this connection involves only
near-horizon physics it is comparatively simple to establish, and we do so for
perturbations in both the Schwarzschild geometry (which is the one most often
studied theoretically) and the Kerr geometry (which is the one of observational
interest for post-merger ring down). In passing we identify the
renormalization-group evolution of the effective couplings as a function of a
regularization distance from the horizon, that enforces how physics does not
depend on the precise position where the boundary conditions are imposed. We
show that the perfect-absorber/perfect-emitter boundary conditions of General
Relativity correspond to the only fixed points of this evolution. Nontrivial
running of all other RG evolution reflects how modifications to gravity
necessarily introduce new physics near the horizon.

Axionic extension of the Proca action",Shahab Shahidi,(Submitted on 19 Jun 2018 (," In the context of Cartan theory, we will show that the Proca action can be
obtained from the Gauss-Bonnet action for a special choice of the torsion
tensor. This in fact equivalent to the special case of the 4th vector Galileon
Lagrangian. The theory will then be promoted to contain an axion field. It will
be proved that the model admits de Sitter expanding phase with healthy tensor
and vector fluctuations. The scalar sector has 4 degrees of freedom, but only
one of them remains dynamical in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$. We will
analyze the scalar fluctuations in the small scales limit and obtain the
parameter space of the theory in which all the perturbations remain healthy.

Squashing the Boundary of Supersymmetric AdS$_5$ Black Holes","Davide Cassani,Lorenzo Papini",(Submitted on 6 Sep 2018 (," We construct new supersymmetric black holes in five-dimensional supergravity
with an arbitrary number of vector multiplets and Fayet-Iliopoulos gauging.
These are asymptotically locally AdS$_5$ and the conformal boundary comprises a
squashed three-sphere with $\text{SU}(2)\times \text{U}(1)$ symmetry. The
solution depends on two parameters, of which one determines the angular
momentum and the Page electric charges, while the other controls the squashing
at the boundary. The latter is arbitrary, however in the flow towards the
horizon it is attracted to a value that only depends on the other parameter of
the solution. The entropy is reproduced by a simple formula involving the
angular momentum and the Page charges, rather than the holographic charges.
Choosing the appropriate five-dimensional framework, the solution can be
uplifted to type IIB supergravity on $S^5$ and should thus be dual to
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills on a rotating, squashed Einstein universe.

Subregion Action and Complexity","Mohsen Alishahiha,Komeil Babaei Velni,M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar",(Submitted on 17 Sep 2018 (," We evaluate finite part of the on-shell action for black brane solutions of
Einstein gravity on different subregions of spacetime enclosed by null
boundaries. These subregions include the intersection of WDW patch with
past/future interior and left/right exterior for a two sided black brane.
Identifying the on-shell action on the exterior regions with subregion
complexity one finds that it obeys subadditivity condition. This gives an
insight to define a new quantity named mutual complexity. We will also consider
certain subregion that is a part of spacetime which could be causally connected
to an operator localized behind/outside the horizon. Taking into account all
terms needed to have a diffeomorphism invariant action with a well-defined
variational principle, one observes that the main contribution that results to
a nontrivial behavior of the on- shell action comes from joint points where two
lightlike boundaries (including horizon) intersect. A spacelike boundary gives
rise to a linear time growth, while we have a classical contribution due to a
timelike boundary that is given by the free energy.

Polarization of a stochastic gravitational wave background through  diffusion by massive structures","Giulia Cusin,Ruth Durrer,Pedro G. Ferreira",(Submitted on 27 Jul 2018 (," The geometric optics approximation traditionally used to study the
propagation of gravitational waves on a curved background, breaks down in the
vicinity of compact and extended astrophysical objects, where wave-like effects
like diffusion and generation of polarization occur. We provide a framework to
study the generation of polarization of a stochastic background of
gravitational waves propagating in an inhomogeneous universe. The framework is
general and can be applied to both cosmological and astrophysical gravitational
wave backgrounds in any frequency range. We derive an order of magnitude
estimate of the amount of polarization generated for cosmological and
astrophysical backgrounds, in the frequency range covered by present and
planned gravitational wave experiments. For an astrophysical background in the
PTA and LISA band, the amount of polarization generated is suppressed by a
factor $10^{-4}$ $(10^{-5})$ with respect to anisotropies. For a cosmological
background we get an additional $10^{-2}$ suppression. We speculate on using
our approach to map the distribution of (unresolvable) structures in the
Universe.

Fast, ultra-luminous X-ray bursts from tidal stripping of White Dwarfs  by Intermediate-Mass Black Holes",Rong-Feng Shen,(Submitted on 25 Sep 2018)," Two X-ray sources were recently discovered by Irwin et al. in compact
companions to elliptical galaxies to show ultra-luminous flares with fast rise
(~ minute) and decay (~ hour), and with a peak luminosity ~$10^{40-42}$ erg/s.
Together with other 5 sources found earlier, they comprise a new type of fast
transients which cannot be attributed to neutron stars but might be to
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $10^{2-4} M_{\odot}$). The flaring
behaviour is recurrent for at least 3 sources. If the flare represents a short
period of accretion onto the IMBH during the periastron passage of a donor star
on an eccentric (i.e., repeating) or parabolic orbit (non-repeating), we argue
that the flare's rise time corresponds to the duration during which the donor's
tidally stripped mass joins a residual disk at the pericenter. This duration is
in turn equal to the other three time scales: the duration of the stripping,
the sound crossing time of the donor, and the circular orbit time at the
pericenter radius. Only can a white dwarf have a sound crossing time as short
as one minute. Therefore, the donor must be a white dwarf and it was stripped
of ~$10^{-10} M_{\odot}$ upon each passage at several to tens of Schwarzschild
radii from the IMBH. The flux decay corresponds to the viscous drainage of the
supplied mass toward the hole. Aided with long-term X-ray monitoring, this type
of fast transients would be an ideal target for next-generation gravitational
wave detectors.

Spin Hall effect of gravitational waves",Naoki Yamamoto,(Submitted on 10 Aug 2017 (," Gravitons possess a Berry curvature due to their helicity. We derive the
semiclassical equations of motion for gravitons taking into account the Berry
curvature. We show that this quantum correction leads to the splitting of the
trajectories of right- and left-handed gravitational waves in curved space, and
that this correction can be understood as a topological phenomenon. This is the
spin Hall effect (SHE) of gravitational waves. We find that the SHE of
gravitational waves is twice as large as that of light. Possible future
observations of the SHE of gravitational waves can potentially test the quantum
nature of gravitons beyond the classical general relativity.

Hamiltonian analysis of a topological theory in the presence of  boundaries","Alejandro Corichi,Tatjana Vukašinac",(Submitted on 24 Sep 2018)," We perform the canonical Hamiltonian analysis of a topological gauge theory,
that can be seen both as a theory defined on a four dimensional spacetime
region with boundaries --the bulk theory--, or as a theory defined on the
boundary of the region --the boundary theory--. In our case the bulk theory is
given by the 4-dimensional $U(1)$ Pontryagin action and the boundary one is
defined by the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action. We analyse the conditions that need
to be imposed on the bulk theory so that the total Hamiltonian, smeared
constraints and generators of gauge transformations be well defined
(differentiable) for generic boundary conditions. We pay special attention to
the interplay between the constraints and boundary conditions in the bulk
theory on the one side, and the constraints in the boundary theory, on the
other side. We illustrate how both theories are equivalent, despite the
different canonical variables and constraint structure, by explicitly showing
that they both have the same symmetries, degrees of freedom and observables.

Weyl symmetry and its spontaneous breaking in Standard Model and  inflation","D. M. Ghilencea,Hyun Min Lee",(Submitted on 24 Sep 2018)," We discuss the Weyl gauge symmetry and its spontaneous breaking and apply it
to model building beyond Standard Model (SM) and inflation. In models
containing non-minimal couplings of the scalar fields to the Ricci scalar, that
are conformal invariant, the spontaneous generation by a scalar field(s) vev
(or combination thereof) of a positive Newton constant demands a negative
kinetic term for the scalar field, or vice-versa. This is naturally avoided in
models with additional Weyl gauge symmetry. The Weyl gauge field $\omega_\mu$,
shown to couple only to the scalar sector of a SM-like Lagrangian, undergoes a
Stueckelberg mechanism and becomes massive after ""eating"" the (radial mode)
would-be-Goldstone field (dilaton $\rho$) in the scalar sector. Before the
decoupling of $\omega_\mu$, the dilaton can act as UV regulator and maintain
the Weyl symmetry at the quantum level, with relevance for solving the
hierarchy problem. After the decoupling of $\omega_\mu$, the scalar potential
depends only on the remaining (angular variables) scalar fields. A successful
hilltop inflation is then possible with one of these scalar fields identified
as the inflaton. While our approach is formulated in Riemannian geometry, the
natural framework is that of Weyl geometry which is shown to lead to a similar
Lagrangian, up to a total derivative.

how the topological invariants emerge. The machinery used here emphasizes
intrinsic properties of the leaves instead of observer dependent quantities -
such as a time function, a local rest frame or a Cauchy hypersurface. Finally,
we discuss the celebrated Hopf-Ra\~nada solution in details and stress how the
foliation approach may help in future developments of the theory of
electromagnetic knots. We conclude with several possible applications,

Gravitational wave detection from OJ 287 via a pulsar timing array","Jie-Wen Chen,Yang Zhang",(Submitted on 25 Sep 2018)," Blazar OJ 287 is a candidate nanoHertz (nHz) gravitational wave (GW) source.
In this article, we investigate the GWs generated by OJ 287 and their potential
detection through a pulsar timing array (PTA). First, we obtain the orbit and
the corresponding GW strain of OJ 287. During the time span of the next 10
years (2019 to 2029), the GW of OJ 287 will be active before 2021, with a peak
strain amplitude $8 \times 10^{-16}$, and then decay after that. When OJ 287 is
silent in the GW channel during 2021 to 2029, the timing residual signals of
the PTA will be dominated by the 'pulsar term' of the GW strain and this
provides an opportunity to observe this pulsar term. Furthermore, we choose 26
pulsars with white noise below 300 ns to detect the GW signal of OJ 287,
evaluating their timing residuals and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The total
SNR (with a cadence of 2 weeks in the next 10 years) of the PTA ranges from 1.9
to 2.9, corresponding to a weak GW signal for the current sensitivity level.
Subsequently, we investigate the potential measurement of the parameters of OJ
287 using these pulsars. In particular, PSR J0437-4715, with a precisely
measured distance, has the potential to constrain the polarization angle with
an uncertainty below $8^{\deg}$ and this pulsar will play an important role in
future PTA observations.

Consistent derivation of the Hawking effect for both non-extremal and  extremal Kerr black holes","Subhajit Barman,Golam Mortuza Hossain",(Submitted on 25 Sep 2018)," It is believed that extremal black holes do not emit Hawking radiation as

an exact canonical derivation of the Hawking effect for non-extremal Kerr black
holes. Subsequently, for extremal Kerr black holes we show that the required
consistency condition is satisfied in the canonical derivation and it produces
zero number density for Hawking particles. We also point out the reason behind

we solve completely the Dirac equation finding a general spinor solution and
deriving the propagators. We show that in the Minkowski flat spacetime our new

representation of the fermion propagators. The form of the Feynman propagator

stealth's contributions to the energy density in both cases, and for the
pressure in the power-low cosmology, which means that such contributions to

$H_0$ Tension and the Phantom Regime: A Case Study In Terms of $f(T)$  Gravity","Amr El-Zant,W. El Hanafy,Sherif Elgammal",(Submitted on 25 Sep 2018)," We propose an $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity theory including a torsional
infrared (IR) correction. We show that the governing Friedmann's equations of a
spatially flat universe include a phantom-like effective dark energy term
sourced by the torsion IR correction. As has been suggested, this phantom phase
does indeed act as to reconcile the tension between local and global
measurements of the current Hubble value $H_0$. The resulting cosmological
model predicts an electron scattering optical depth $\tau_e\thickapprox 0.058$
at reionization redshift $z_{re} \sim 8.1$, in agreement with observations. The
predictions are however in contradiction with baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) measurements, particularly the distance indicators. We argue that this is
the case with any model with a phantom dark energy model that has effects
significant enough at redshifts $z \lesssim 2$ as to be currently observable.
The reason being that such a scenario introduces systematic differences in
terms of distance estimates in relation to the standard model; e.g., if the
angular diameter distance to the recombination era is to be kept constant while
$H_0$ is increased in the context of a phantom scenario, the distances there
are systematically overestimated to all objects at redshifts smaller than
recombination. But no such discrepancies exist between $\Lambda$CDM predictions
and current data for $z \lesssim 2$.

exact solution, which is an attractor of the dynamics governed by a positive
periodic potential $V(\phi)=E+ F \cos (\Omega \phi )+G \cos (2 \Omega \phi )$.
The spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with
the recent observational data. If we ignore reheating and creation of matter
after the end of inflation, this solution develops a period of deceleration and
a second period of acceleration, consistent with the experimental results. This
